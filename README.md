So! Fun idea. A Discord bot and web page 

Bot side:

Connect to configured channel and server
Listen for messages:

* `!add <movie or show>` - adds a movie to the database and creates a vote for it
* `!pick @UserName1 @UserName2` - picks a random show
* `!remove <movie or show>` - removes a movie for consideration

Web side

* Select the profile pic of people watching show
* Button to choose a show
